	The Wallarm FAST plugin has 2 modes of operation: recording and testing.
	In recording mode, the FAST application will act as a proxy. Any traffic sent through FAST will be recorded as a baseline and saved to a TestRecord for later use.
	In Playback mode, the FAST application will use an existing TestRecord to generate a TestRun.
